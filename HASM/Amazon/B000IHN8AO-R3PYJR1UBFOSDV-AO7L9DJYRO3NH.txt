READ THE COMMENTS TO THE REVIEWS HERE. DO NOT RELY ON THEM ALONE. I am a newbie (well, a prospective, researching newbie) and am doing my homework before I shell out the bucks for a decent DSLR as I've outgrown my Nikon Coolpix 8800. From what I can tell from my homework, the Pentax is a great camera -- ergo the distinguished awards it won in Europe and Japan for being the best camera of 2007 -- but has trouble in low-light situations with the auto-focus. This is important to me, since I do a lot of low-light shooting in jazz clubs. I need a camera that can handle those sorts of situations as well as one that can handle portraiture, landscapes and such. On that issue alone, I am leaning against this camera and toward the Nikon D80 or D200. The Canon 30D would be great, but (and I know this isn't as important to some) it only has 8MP, which is what I have now. I want the ability to crop photos without losing too much data, so that camera is out of the running. In an ideal world, all these cameras would be 12MP, but the price for those are astronomical to me and I can't justify one of the costlier Canons. But to say, as this reviewer does -- without qualification -- that this camera is only good if you have Pentax legacy lenses is just not true and is misleading. I still don't understand (perhaps it's the time of night I am writing this) his explanation of why he said this, as there are, from what I can see, plenty of Pentax lenses. All of which is a pity since all the lenses in the world can't make up for a camera that can't supremely handle low-light situations.
