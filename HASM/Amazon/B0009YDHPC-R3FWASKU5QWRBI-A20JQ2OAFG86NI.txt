Title: Good coffee, good espresso-a little tricky though...
Content:
I am a self-confessed coffee junkie.  With or w/o the caffeine (pregnancy and such) I love the taste; and the taste of the coffee that I've brewed with this machine was great.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  The machine was easy to use and looked pretty darn cool sitting there on my counter.  The only issue that i have is that the espresso side seems to need some encouragement.  The knobs need to be fiddled with a bit in order to get the espresso to start dripping (even after 10 minutes during a holiday party full of thirsty coffee drinkers).  Thought that was just b/c my machine was so new, but it's been doing that ever since the first use.  Still, it's not terribly difficult, and the coffee is oh-so-yummy!
