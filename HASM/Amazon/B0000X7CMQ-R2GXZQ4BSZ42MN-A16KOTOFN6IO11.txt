Title: Buyer Beware
Content:
My wife and I bought this from Amazon in mid December '04 and were quite impressed with its speed and ease of use. A couple of weeks ago, we discovered the maker was starting to kick off before the all the water had been passed out of the reservoir and into the basket. So, in order to make an entire pot of coffee, someone now has to stand there and keep turning it back on after it kicks off. We've contacted Zojirushi about the problem, but haven't heard back yet. When we checked other's reviews of this product, this switch problem now seems endemic with this maker. My hope is that Zojirushi, if it doesn't want to lose customers, provides a replacement without customers having to pay shipping costs, etc. to get a new maker. If we don't get a timely and cost-effective replacement, we're done with this brand for good, and I think Amazon should think twice about selling this maker.
