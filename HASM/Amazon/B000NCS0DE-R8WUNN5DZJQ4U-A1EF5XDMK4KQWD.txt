Title: great buy for hairy messes
Content:
my border collie loves to leave traces of himself all over the floors and furniture. I used to use tons of lint rollers to try to pick his hair up until I found this hand vac. For being pretty small its powerful! As long as you angle it the right way it picks up virtually everything. I even started to replace my regular vacuum with this handy tool since it is easier to lug around. The only negative is that it does get hot pretty quickly. I have never had it shut off on me as some of the other reviews mentioned but I do try to give it a break when cleaning several rooms at once.
