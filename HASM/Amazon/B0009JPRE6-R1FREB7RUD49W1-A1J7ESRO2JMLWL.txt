Title: Great, reliable camera.
Content:
I am a professional photographer, and I have owned this camera for nearly two years.  I also have a D70 for backup.  The batteries go forever, it is very quick to respond, the images are beautiful, and it has the typical Nikon durability and reliability.  If you are already a Nikon user, the controls will fall easily to hand.
That having been said, the computer software with this camera is a joke.  For the best image quality shoot RAW files, color balance with a grey card, and render the images with software like Capture One LE.  The uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars.  Come on, Nikon, be real!!!
Shortly after I got my first D70, I shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog.  I got an ugly feeling in my gut when I was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure, cropped to the head and shoulders, and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog.  By the time I found out, it was already at the printer.  As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great.  After that incident, I have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results.
This camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button.  In resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera.  It is imperative to shoot RAW and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera.
I can't wait to try the D80!
