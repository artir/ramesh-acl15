Title: Top Notch affordable digital SLR
Content:
The K10D has a good mix of features and accessible menus.  The camera will take great pictures on the fully automatic "green mode" while allowing priority functions for shutter speed or aperture as well as manual mode.  The shake-reduction feature gives more confidence in the shot without a tripod in marginal light.
Be aware that the camera CAN be operated with lenses with no auto focus/auto aperture KA lenses that fit manual SLR cameras.  But one has to take some time setting up the custom settings to allow manual aperture settings or the camera will not allow the shutter to be activated.  Also if the shake reduction is on, the camera menu will request lens information.  The camera works much better with KAF2, but can be set to work with ANY previous K mount lens version.  
The picture clarity and resolution are excellent.  Although I have been using the JPEG file format, there are options for RAW in Pentax PEF or Adobe DNG that have no in camera brightness or contrast adjustment.  Or one can set the camera to JPEG and the selected RAW format either automatically or at the push of a button for specific shots.
I find this is a great camera for those familar with film SLR cameras, but could be overwhelming for those who only use point and shoot cameras.
