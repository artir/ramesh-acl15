Title: Not just a dumbed-down "consumer"  version DSLR
Content:
The K10D is the real deal, not just a dumbed-down version of a Pro-DSLR like some of the competing products.  
That said, if you're an amateur (such as myself), you need to take the time to learn about aperature, shutter speed, depth of field, etc (Amazon offers numerous books on photography)... to fully take advantage of this spectacular device, otherwise you're better off with a DSLR that offers "Scene Modes" and other automatic settings...
In terms of value, the K10D is without a doubt the best all around DSLR at its price point... it feels like the most solidly built peice of consumer electronics I can recall using.
