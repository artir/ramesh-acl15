Title: I HATE THIS VAC
Content:
My mom bought this vac for me for my Bridal shower. 
She picked it up in Target with my sister after having a laugh when they saw the vac was called  "the retriever" 
My husband and I have a 90 lb blond Golden who sheds like crazy. After one or two rounds vaccuming my couch and stairs the retreiver attachment became entangled with his fur.  I had to break apart the attachment I could not get the bristles clean.  I HATE that vac.   Now I use my swiffer vac on my hard wood. A lint roller on my couch, and TV's One Sweep (sweepa) to rake the dog hair out of my area rug.  UGH! Thanks "Retriever" you stink
