Title: Finally, a small pro machine from Pentax!
Content:
Pentax has been knows for the finest glass in the industry, but after the 1960's or 1970's their professional gear has all been medium format.
Well, the digital revolution finally woke them up.  Many pros have been using Pentax 35mm cameras because of the glass, and the *st D was a good holder for the lenses.
So now they finally came out with a pro-spec digital (too bad about the failed MZ-D years ago) and it's not the 645D, it's the K10D!
The camera is solid, robust, uses a high-voltage power supply, and with the battery pack is one mean machine.   Plus, it natively saves in DNG format so pros don't have to wait for Thomas Knoll at Adobe to profile the camera - native DNG goes right into Adobe Bridge!
The shake reduction feature makes ALL your lenses IS lenses, not just the $[...] monsters.  The 300/2.8 and 600/4 are still available, should you want them and have the money to spend.
The most impressive part to me is the fact that it automatically senses the orientation of the photos.  Portraits don't have to be rotated after the fact, which saves time in post-processing.  For a working photographer, that means a lot!
Over all, for image quality and features, you can't match it until you get up to the hyper-expensive Canon 5D, at which point you're better off going medium format digital.  The 645D will be the one to look for.
But for the regular photographer, this is one serious machine!
