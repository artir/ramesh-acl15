Title: As good as expected
Content:
I've searched a lot before choosing the K10D and the camera ended up just as good as expected.
The body is just like any professional equipment, bulk and heavy enough to help the hand shaking not to be transferred to the picture. By the way the shake reduction is just wonderful! You can take a 1/15' picture without any blurry.
And all the settings can be easily accessed using the program mode dial and the two smaller dials available at your fingertips.
The 18-55mm lens & camera body pack is the best you can get! I've looked all around in USA and Canada and could not find a bargain like this! 
The lens itself is just enough as a start: really wide and a nice zoom on the same set.
The battery is a warning point: buy a spare one or you may be suddenly in need for a recharge.
One small setback is the computer cable: why not using the usual USB port (at the camera end)? Now I have another cable to carry around.
And another thing: although the body seems to be compatible with any other Pentax lens, I could not get auto-focus with my old 80-300mm one...
But it still deserves a 5 star rating!
