Title: Another good Pentax camera
Content:
The only thing this camera does not have that I wish it did was a live preview.  It is backwards compatible with my older Pentax lens, so I would rather have that than a live preview.  Also, and almost as important to me, it uses AA batteries.  I will not buy any product that uses a "special" battery...they are overpriced and you have to have at least two to have a spare.  I have 24 NiMH rechargeables and a charger analyzer that keeps them in good shape.  I thank Pentax for those two features.  By the way, the picture quality is excellent.  The colors are vivid and well saturated with and without the flash.  The flash works well up close (3 feet) unlike most others.  The pictures are sharp and well defined from edge to edge.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had a live preview.  I had looked at two companies who said they were in stock for immediate shipment, but when I ordered the camera and did not buy an expensive Li-Ion battery and large "extremely fast" memory card they were all of a sudden out of stock.  Both of them NYC Broadway camera companies.  I ordered from Amazon, which cost a little more, but had the camera in two days with no shipping cost.  Thanks Amazon for being there again.  I should have never wandered away.
