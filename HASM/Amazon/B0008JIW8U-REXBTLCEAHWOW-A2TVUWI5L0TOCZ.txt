Title: Rusty
Content:
I have just thrown out my second one. I really enjoyed my first 4-cup programmable Mr. Coffee maker so I bought another when the first one croked. After about two years, I noticed stains under it on my counter top. Apparently the machine had a small leak and the bottom had completely rusted. I have not been able to clean the rust stains from my counter. I was pleased with the coffee, but it was not worth the stains on my ceramic counters.
