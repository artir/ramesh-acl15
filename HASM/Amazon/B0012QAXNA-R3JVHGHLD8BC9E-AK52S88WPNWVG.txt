Title: K200D V ME Super
Content:
Having owned a Pentax ME Super SLR for more years than I like to admit, and having had a Minolta digital point and shoot for a few years I decided it was about time I bought a DSLR. I used to shoot slide film all the time, but it is now getting ridiculously expensive to develop and hard to get hold of.
I wanted to use all my old Pentax lenses so the K200d seemed a natural progression. I bought one from Amazon with the 18-55 lens autofocus lens.
I am so pleased with this camera!! I have read some negative comments regarding size etc, but to be honest,  I love the solid well engineered feel of it and since I bought it I have looked at a Canon and a Nikon and thought the build quality was inferior.
If you want a DSLR It would be hard to be disappointed with the K200D. I have tried my old standard 50mm 1.7 lens and a Tamron zoom with Carl Zeiss lens and got terrific pictures immediately and being an ME Super user I didn't even miss the autofocus
The built in flash is good enough for short range stuff and I have taken some good flash fill daylight shots with it, but I will now be buying a Pentax flash and I expect I will be happy with this camera for many years
I love it...get one.
