Title: style over substance
Content:
i bought this coffeepot even though it didn't have any reviews because i thought it looked cute and that the cuisinart brand was quality. unfortunately, i've had a lot of problems with this coffeepot and now i'm kicking myself for not going with one of the other better-reviewed ones. first, i find the tiny hole you have to pour the water into kind of awkward. my boyfriend doesn't, but i do - if you don't pour the water in just so it spills everywhere. in addition, sometimes when i try to pull out the carafe midstream to pour a cup (it SHOULD pause) it doesn't pause and it just keeps spewing out coffee and it starts sizzling/smoking when it hits the bottom (and once you put the carafe back it gets even worse). and it takes FOREVER to dry - even if i leave it open all day it's STILL wet at night.
despite these problems, about 60% of the time it works OK and i have no complaints, it looks cute, and it has a great timer feature that brews your coffee for you in the morning.
