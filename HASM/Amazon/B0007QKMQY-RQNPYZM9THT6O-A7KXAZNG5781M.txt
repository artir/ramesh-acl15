Title: Wonderful Camera - but
Content:
I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.)
