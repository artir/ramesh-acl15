Title: Excellent camera
Content:
The Pentax K20D takes excellent pictures and is  very easy to use. I bought this model over less expensive Pentax DSLRs because it had LiveView. It would be nice to be able to focus while using LiveView, but this apparently is not technically possible. I do a lot of macro photography and even though LiveView is a great feature to have, I get by with just the viewfinder most of the time. 
I added an Eye-Fi wireless SD card which sends my pictures directly to my computer without the need to plug it in, so I haven't used the Pentax bundled software.
I added a grip, extra battery, and remote control. It is great to have an extra battery, remote, and extra SD card stored in the grip. The grip makes it a bit heavy - very much like an film SLR. 
Overall it is an easy to use camera right out of the box. Oh, if you buy this camera from Amazon, it comes with the same accessories as if you bought it from the Pentax store (not gray market or repackaged). For some reason Amazon doesn't list what is in the box as Pentax does. It took several phone calls and then a roll of the dice to finally confirm that everything listed on the Pentax site was the same as what came in the box on Amazon's site. One thing to note though is that while it comes with an AC cord, it is not an AC adapter to power the camera. The AC cord it comes with is for the battery charger. If you want to power the directly from AC you must buy the AC adapter. Neither Pentax or Amazon are clear about this detail. The AC adapter is about $100 extra. Most people will not need it. Battery power is excellent, though a spare is nice to have. The battery charges fully in less than 3 hours and full charge is indicated by a light on the charger.
