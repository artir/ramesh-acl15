Title: Looks great, but not well designed, plus IT LEAKS!
Content:
We've had this coffee maker for about 8 months, got it because a) cuisinart has a solid reputation, and b) we wanted a machine with simple, no bell-and-whistles operation.  It does look really nice, very functional, but in reality, the filter and the water inlet are way too close together and the top doesn't come off for cleaning, making the whole thing a fairly messy machine. You wind up with coffee grounds all over the place. I can deal with that, but now, over the last week it has developed a serious leak. About half the water comes out the  bottom of the machine, burning hot, So if you want 5 cups of coffee, you've got to put in 10 cups of water, and you get five cups of boiling water all over the counter. It's not worth repairing, the repair would be as much as the machine, so I'm tossing it and replacing with another brand of coffee maker (Technivorm Moccamaster) that is more expensive but doesn't sound like it'll have the issues the cuisinart does.
