Title: Love this coffee maker!
Content:
I think this coffee maker is great.  Other people have complained about the coffee going all over if the pot isn't lined up properly when you start the coffee.  To me, it is just plain laziness if you can't LOOK at where it needs to be before brewing to insure the coffee doesn't end up on the counter.  Sure, maybe you shouldn't HAVE to do that, but big deal, really.  For the other features it offers, I am fine with having to pay attention to where the pot is positioned.  Some people have also complained about the coffee not staying hot....WHAT?!?!  No kidding, I brewed a pot of coffee at 2 pm one afternoon and the next morning, at about 10 am, the coffee was still warm!  Not hot enough to drink, but after 20 hours it was still warm?  I think that is pretty darned good!  I also like the fact that the water spigot, (where the water goes into the grounds), has multiple holes for a shower like effect, which more thoroughly saturates the grounds.  The only thing that I have a little problem with is the lid.  Because of the shape of the lid, it can hurt your hand a bit when you have to twist it from being on really tight.  Other than that, I love it!  I also got a Swissgold filter basket to go with it, which I highly recommend.
