Title: Worth every penny
Content:
I started with a D50 and have loved it from the very begining. I felt ready to step up to the next level, but didn't think I was ready for the d200. When I heard about the d80, I read everything I could. The biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body. I don't use all of the mode setting and find myself in Shutter and Aperture Priority most of the time, but it's nice to have the others there when I don't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings.
The in camera image enhancements are amazing--but a word of caution. Vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots--if not too much so.
I've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years.
Compared to the Canon 30d (which I was thinking about) or even the new 400d (I haven't actually held one yet), this is the Nikon to have.
On batter life, I had a recent shoot where I took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period. The battery was at about half and that's with quite a bit of LCD viewing.
At this level both Canon and Nikon offer great equipment--you can't go wrong with either. Just get one of each in your hands, snap a few shots, and go with the one that feels the best for you.
