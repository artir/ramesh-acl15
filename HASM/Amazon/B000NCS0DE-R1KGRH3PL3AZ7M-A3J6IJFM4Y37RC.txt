Title: Ok power but not enough for car vacuuming
Content:
I'm not sorry that I purchased the vacuum but it does have it's limitations.  When I tried to vacuum the floor of my car it wouldn't pick up even the tiniest pebbles or bits of gravel. It worked fine on the seats but it got hot after a while and turned itself off for about 20 minutes! I was sure that it was ruined but after 20 minutes it worked fine again.  It worked great in the house on dust in those hard to vacuum areas like under the desk & behind the TV.  Also worked great on shredded paper on the floor by the shredder.  I'll enjoy having it for such things but I'll still be dragging out the 20 year old shop vac for the car.  Oh, the special retriever head kept falling apart in my hands (not put together right at the factory).  I had to figure out how to put the tiny belt on and snap it back together myself.  Not the end of the world but when you take something like that out of the box you expect it to work.
