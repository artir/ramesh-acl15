Title: My final decision
Content:
After way too much time infront of a PC reading reviews or a camera store counter (damn I was sick of it), this D80 is what I chose. Bought it 2 weeks ago and then went on a 10 day trip West. After draging it everywhere I has not let me down. For the price its perfect. I'm still working out exactly how to make it work to its potential aswell as fighting understanding of other manufacturers camera layouts in my head) At work I have a Rebel Xt I bought last year as I need its compact casing. My Brother has the Canon D30 after he progressed from the XT and a friend on the west coast has the D200. Having experience both I still love what I chose. My biggest reason however for going again with Nikon was that I already have a N6006 film camera with a lens and my hope was I could use its Nikkor AF 35-105mm with this camera and give myself more options. After reading lots of reviews as to whether this was possible and finally taking the lens to a shop I found it worked fine. Experience in the field in the last 10 days has shown it does not work seemlessly buy that may well be me not the lens. The 2.5 inch LCD is sooo much easier to read than the Rebel XT. The info read out on top is much better placed than the one above the LCD on the XT (if obstructed in an architectural model shoot and I can't see through the viewfinder myself, I certainly can't see the info screen if its below it). I didn't go with the 18-135 in the end for a lens as there is a vinyetting issue at the high end which bothered me. I got a great deal for the same price at Cameraland in New Hampshire for the D80 and the  (D70s) 18-70mm tried and trusted lens. Fab. Now need to save up and wait for the release of the  80-300 VR lens thats coming out. Would love the 80-400 Vr but its 3 times the price.
My hardest time was finiding someone with it in stock, at a price I wanted to pay, the set up I wanted and who wasn't trying to make a dodgie deal (like some of those cheap web based places in NYC).It really was the hardest part of the purchase in the end. I was surprised. Many people were almost reluctant to make a sale. It was wierd. Parts are hard to get too apparently like a spare battery and very few places have the 18-135 lens instock either.    
Anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera. I hope it takes many great pictures for you.
