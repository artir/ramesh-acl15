Title: Fabulous!
Content:
I've had the K200D for about two weeks now and have no regrets. This is the best camera out there for the money. If you have any interest at all in learning to take better pictures this camera will be ready as you learn more, but it's also good for the true beginner with lots of auto modes to help you. 
I think the things that make this better than the competition are 1) shake reduction in the body. When you start buying lenses you don't have to keep paying for that feature in every single lens (nikon VR?) 2)very durable body construction and weather/dust sealed. Any DA lenses you attach are as well. This is only available in cameras for the pros normally. 3)all pentax lenses for the last 3 or 4 decades can be used, some older manual ones need a $10 adapter--but you can buy tons of used awesome old lenses on ebay for very cheap. 4)this kit lens is the best kit lens out there. I've read alot of reviews and all the experts agree this is the best. It was made for the camera that is one step up from this  model--but it's included with the K200D as well. 5)Pentax has an awesome PRIME lens for under $200 (amazon) that everyone raves about. I got it and I agree. FA 50mm F1.4 Get it. You won't be sorry. 5)the RAW button on the side is quite a nice perk. You can program it to suit your needs and it saves you from going into menus to make changes on the fly.6)Takes great pictures--gorgeous colors--makes me look good!7) the menus are clear and easy to understand. There are even some interesting ways to edit your photos right on the camera. I also like the HDR feature which gives more detail in the shadows than would normally be picked up. Thats alot of bells and whistles for an "entry level" DSLR.
