Title: Solid Like a Rock!
Content:
I bought this camera over the standard brands (cannon/nikon) because of my previous experience with a fully manual k1000 camera. I am not disappointed! This camera feels sturdy with its metal frame. I had a little dust on the sensor out of the box. The built in shake feature took care of that no problem.
I went out today shooting and the camera performed flawlessly. The pictures are sharp and bright. I recommend shooting in RAW mode (the pictures come out even sharper).
This camera is an amazing value. You wont have the lens availability that you get with cannon or nikon, but if you do your research you can find tons of good glass. You wont be sorry if you pick up this camera.
