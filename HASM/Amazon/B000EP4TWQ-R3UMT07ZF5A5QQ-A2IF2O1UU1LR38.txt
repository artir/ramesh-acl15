Title: Dumped 4GB nano for this
Content:
I was impressed with the 1st generation nano 4gb.  However 4gb is too small to hold all my legally purchased songs as I use 320kbps in encoding.  Therefore I took the 2G nano 8gb.  Here are my 2 cent:
The Good:
- The finish now resists some scratches, which is what we are looking for
- Probably the best quality 8gb player on the market at this price range.  Big bang for your money.
- It seems more responsive than the previous nano.
- It supports song searching now.
The Bad:
- Personally I perfer the silver color, but the black color is the only option for 8gb. 
- The packaging looks like a cheaper product than the 1st nano; in fact $249 for a mp3 is not cheap at all
- I don't know if the sound quality has been improved or degraded using my Shure earphone.  But at least I can recognize the default "EQ off" has been tweaked, which I need some time to get used to.
- The LCD display is brighter, but the contrast does not look better than 1st nano.
- I can't get iTune 7.0.0 working on my PC.  It seems like Apple was forced to release it the same day Steve speaks.  It is a big disappointment.  Finally 7.0.1 came to fix my problem.
- It does not fit to 1st generation Nano Dock.  It is an unexpected big disappointment.  I really don't understand why Apple can't make it compatible with the former dock, as the connector is just shifted to the edge a mm!
The 2nd nano deserves a 4-stars, as it does not beat the 1st nano.  Anyway it is a hard competitor for Zune to beat.
