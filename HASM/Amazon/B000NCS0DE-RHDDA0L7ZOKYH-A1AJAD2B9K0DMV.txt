Title: Good price. Works well.
Content:
I bought this to pick up dust every now and then in my studio apartment. I preferred the corded types because the cordless ones had to be charged and would lose it's charge faster as it gets older. I think this had the best reviews versus the cordless/rechargeable types and the other small corded types. The cord of this thing is long enough, and I could vacuum half of my apartment at a time, and then plugging it into an electrical outlet on the other side of my apartment to vacuum the other side. Suction is strong, easy to clean (you just have to empty the bin). Picks up dust balls, little pieces of shredded paper, beads from a necklace that I broke, etc. I did not want a big heavy duty vacuum cleaner because I had such a small space. This one fit well in my storage closet area, bottom shelf. So, first I vacuum little dust balls here and there. Then I use a Swiffer sweeper to wipe off the rest of the dust on my wood floor. If you're on a budget, small space, light cleaning now and then, this will work for you. Works for me.
