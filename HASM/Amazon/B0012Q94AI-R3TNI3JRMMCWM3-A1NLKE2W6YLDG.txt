This is a great camera!  At 400 ISO and below it takes amazingly detailed pictures without any visable noise even if photos are cropped. The learning curve to use the custom functions is a bit steep, however. It comes with a thick manual and I'm still learning all the functions. I already had a lot of 35mm pentax lenses and its compatiblity with my existing lenses are the main reason I chose this camera over another make. It works great with A series lenses with the lense set to the Auto setting. When the lense apeture ring is set to a F-stop setting manually or if you are using an older lense without the Auto setting, you have to go into the camera's custom setting program and enable the camera for use with the apeture ring set manually for the camera to function. As far as I can tell, when the camera is operated with a m lense the apeture is not stopped down when you take a picture- you have to shoot these lenses wide open. The camera's exposue info indicated when I took a photo of a landscape scene at ISO 200 with my 17mm tokina lense apeture set to F16 that the scene was exposed with a shutter speed of 1/4000 second which should have been way underexposed but the photo appears normal with the normal depth of field you'd expect from this small an apeture. The camera's live view and optical preview modes won't function when I have an M series lense mounted on the camera either. These are minor inconvienances though as the camera's function with A series and later lenses are flawless. In all, I would recomend this camera to anyone looking for a high quality D-SLR camera, especially if you already own one or more pentax 35mm lenses and you are looking to expand to digital photography.
