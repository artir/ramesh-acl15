Title: Just got this camera Last week, so still learning!
Content:
I just baught this camera last week, after reaching the limit of where I felt I could grow with a point and shoot cam. I wanted to move into the more versital world of DSLR. So far so good. I have had good luck with this camera, as stated in other reviews it does have a tendecy to be off a little on color, but not enough you notice when printing out pic. 
I find the menus easy to use, and the camera fits into your hands well. I am a big guy 6+ with large hands and I foun. the Cannon and Olympus Cams to small for my hands (on the flip side, my wife is a petit woman and finds this camera a little big)
I have been using this for a week or two so far in conjuction with Corel® Paint Shop Pro® Photo X2 and I have been able to create some great orginal images. 
Pros:
 - Sharp, crip images
 - Quick Auto Focus
 - Easy Menus
Cons:
 - Bit of a learning cureve from a point and shoot (To be expected since you want the extra versotility, but it takes time to master)
 - Colors are a little off, but not enough to distract from this picture.
