Title: Very solid, great quality, but cheap-looking lens
Content:
I'm not going to repeat all the accolades others have bestowed on this great interchangeable-lens digital SLR.  I just want to add a few real-user observations:
1) The 20D is a very solid camera in your hands.  From the hefty weight to the sizable size and the solid grip, it makes you feel you are holding a real SLR, unlike with the Digital Rebel (EOS 300D).  BTW this is assembled in Japan instead of Taiwan (300D).
2) The camera is very fast.  It's not "instant on" like the Nikon 70D but it's still damned fast with very littel shutter lag.  When you use a high-speed CF card, the shot-to-shot performance is satisfying for most fast-action scenarios.
3) Great auto focus, great exposure, and great picture quality.  Canon's expertise in combining optics and electronics once again shines through.  The prints made from this baby, and in part thanks to the 8MP resolution, is just total pro-quality.
4) The kit lens is not really that good, unlike what Nikon bundles in their kits.  It's still a high-quality lends but the max aperture is slow and the lens itself looks and feels cheap.
5) The old photography wisdom about how an expensive camera does not turn an amateur into a pro overnight still applies.  At least you can impress your girlfriend with cr*p that looks like gold for a second there.  :)  (sorry didn't mean to sound sexist...)
The EOS 20D is one AWESOME digital SLR.  If you are real serious about getting a high-quality SLR, consider the 20D or its Nikon competitor, not a low-priced model.
