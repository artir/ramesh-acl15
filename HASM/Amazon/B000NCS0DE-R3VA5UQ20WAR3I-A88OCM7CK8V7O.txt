Title: Shop Around
Content:
We purchased this hand-held to pick up dog fur and also to get dust off of our dogs fur. The suction is definitely not up to par. I'd compare the suction to one of those inexpensive,unknown name brand vac's you buy at K-mart or some other retailer for 19.95 or less. For a small hand held it is extremely loud and does heat up quickly. This machine is overpriced and I expected much better from Black & Decker. I would definitely shop around for a higher quality hand-held and only buy this unit if it is a last resort. It failed miserably when used to suck up dog fur from a futon mattress, a leather recliner chair. By the way, this unit absolutely will not pick up dust from a computer/keyboard, nor should it be used as such (i.e. as a data vac).
