Title: Very nice starter camera
Content:
I've been using this camera for several months now for a color photography course at my school. I very much enjoy using it as it feels sturdy and fits perfectly in my hands. The only real limitation that I've had with the camera is the poor shooting speed. It wouldn't stop me from buying it over the competition, but it does encourage me to upgrade to a Nikon D90/Canon 40D whenever I get the chance to. 
I shoot mostly RAW files because of how well you can edit them when compared with the default jpegs. You can get some really nice shots/detail with them. I do use the RAW+ featuer so that I can quickly and easily view my photos on my computer and edit out the unuseable pictures. 
I have some long-lasting Kodak rechargeable batteries and they last more than long enough for me to use it for a day. I have the 18-250mm lens kit and while its pretty nice, I don't use it much beyond 125 or so. I do have the battery grip as well which is very useful to have.
I've gotten some really nice shots with the camera over the semester and it's very nice for the price. I'd defiantly recommend it to anyone whose looking for a beginner SLR and does not mind the low burst rate.
