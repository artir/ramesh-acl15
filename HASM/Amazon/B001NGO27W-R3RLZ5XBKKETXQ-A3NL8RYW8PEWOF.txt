Title: Can't beat Cuisinart
Content:
This is my second Cuisinart coffeemaker. My first was the model below this one. As other reviewers have stated, Cuisinart addressed the only two shortcomings to the previous coffeemaker which were a small opening to pour water into and no sight glass, neither of which were that big of a deal. All that really mattered was what came out of it and that was a great pot of coffee. Same with this coffeemaker. 14 cups of great coffee waiting for you when you roll out of bed. I honestly don,t believe I'll ever own another brand of coffeemaker. When it comes to coffee, Cuisinart knows what they're doing.
