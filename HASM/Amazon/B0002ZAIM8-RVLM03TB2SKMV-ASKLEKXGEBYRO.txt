Title: a pretty useful product
Content:
The iPod shuffle is nowhere near as reliable as the other iPods. I've had one break on me, and my new one doesn't work on the "shuffle" setting when listening to podcasts -- what I use my shuffle for.
On the other hand, the full-sized iPods don't do the things I need a shuffle for -- mainly, be really, really small and pretty indestructable. However, I haven't tried out any of the new generation of iPods, so they may solve one or both of these difficulties.
