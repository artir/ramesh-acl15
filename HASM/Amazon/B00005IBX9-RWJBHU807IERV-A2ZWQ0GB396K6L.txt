Title: Great Machine
Content:
I've had my new Cuisinart Coffeemaker for about a week now and it is all I expected and more.  My favorite part is all the "auto" features.  I love being able to program it to have my coffee ready when I get up in the mornings and I love being able to program it to turn off after a certain amount of time.  It seems very sturdy and looks sharp.  Not cheap plastic. The brew basket is easy to remove and clean.  It's easy to program.  And imagine this, it makes a great pot of coffee.
