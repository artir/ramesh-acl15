Title: Stunning camera
Content:
Old pentax 35mm slr workhorse user here. (with a ton of glass) When digital started I had the "state of the art" Nikon coolpix P&S that was... well... quick snapshots. Graduated to an Olympus c8080 and that was decent. Then *finally* Pentax came back on the scene. Finally get a chance to get the old lenses out of storage. And Pentax glass rocks!
One gripe tho... had to drill a hole the lens cap and attach some fishing line so I could just take it off and let it hang. Royal pain to have to figure out what to do with it when you want to take a quick shot. Shame on you Pentax! ;)
